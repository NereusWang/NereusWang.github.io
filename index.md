    + 2020, I applied to participate in the artificial intelligence chip and brain computer interface project of Professor Jan Van Der Spiegel, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Department of Electronics and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania. In the project, I am mainly responsible for data processing such as feature extraction and selection of sEMG signal using machine learning and deep learning through sota neural network model. In the part of machine vision processing, I am mainly responsible for pattern recognition of human gesture features through deep learning and combine sEMG signal with machine vision to process target gesture features. At the same time, I combine the traditional signal detection with machine vision, human gesture node feature recognition, pattern recognition of gesture features, and test the accuracy of algorithm model.

    + This project belongs to a major national project of the Ministry of science and technology of People´s Republic of China. We designed and produced a high-density flexible tactile sensor, which can collect the pulse data of three parts of the human body. We cooperated with Shanghai Longhua Hospital and Guangzhou Hospital of traditional Chinese medicine of Guangdong Province to collect the pulse wave data of human body in Shanghai and Guangzhou, and classified the different pulse conditions of different people. I am mainly responsible for the collection and processing of pulse diagnosis data. Through machine learning and deep learning algorithms, I classify and select the characteristics of the collected pulse diagnosis data, explore the relationship between human pulse wave data and different pulse phenomena in traditional Chinese medicine, and carry out classification and recognition.
