    + The development of artificial intelligence technology has made it widely used in modern medical image analysis. For medical image data of different diseases, we need to establish a multi-modal large-scale deep learning model to identify different medical image data. In this project, I propose a method that integrates attention mechanism, recurrent neural network, and graph neural network to characterize different medical image data. Based on recognition and classification, a multi-dimensional digital medical image processing framework is constructed. The cutting-edge deep mutual information algorithm is used to build a medical data image matcher to identify, retrieve and classify images of different medical diseases.
